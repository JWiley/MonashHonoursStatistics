# Unlike with the MLM, time will not appear as a specific variable in the model; rather we code time measurements directly into the factor loadings
# (Because of defaults built into the lavaan function growth(), we could estimate the full linear LCM with just these first two lines of code)

              # Define the Latent Variables
              int =~ 1*dlpfc1 + 1*dlpfc2 + 1*dlpfc3 + 1*dlpfc4

# Next fit the syntax we wrote to the executive.function data. Here we will estimate the model with Maximum Likelihood (estimator = "ML") and we will allow for missing data using the missing = "FIML" argument. Standard alternatives might include estimator = "MLR" for Robust Maximum Likelihood if we have non-normal continuous data, or estimator = WLSMV if we have discrete data. Could change to missing = "listwise" if we wanted to do only complete-case analysis. This option is actually the lavaan default

                      data = executive.function,

summary(lcm, fit.measures = TRUE, estimates = TRUE, 
        standardize = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)
# we are looking to see if our Model Test User Model: test statistic is non-significant. However, be aware that this test is over-powered and will often be significant in large samples, even in a well fitting model. We also tend to look for CFI/TLI > 0.95, RMSEA  < 0.05, and SRMR < 0.08 to indicate an excellent model fit.

# The Covariances: section shows us the covariance (and correlation if we asked for standardized results) between the intercept and slope. Here we can see that the correlation is strong and negative (r=âˆ’0.499) suggesting that those with the lowest initial levels of DLPFC activation tend to show the strongest increases in activation over time.

# The Intercepts: section shows us the means of the latent factors. the average activation at the initial timepoint is  0.543 and the average rate of change is 0.121 units per wave, both of which are significant.

# Variances: section. The variances of the intercept and slope are significant suggesting there are meaningful individual differences in initial level and rate of change over time.
