# PSY4210 -- Statistics and Data Science for Psychology

This is a hands on, applied statistics and data science unit. It will
introduce methods both from a conceptual and applied perspective. The
unit will make use of `R`, a programming language and environment for
statistics.

`R` is completely controlled by written code. `R` also is open source,
meaning that all of the code used in `R` and in any analysis are
publicly and freely viewable. This is good for science as it means it
is possible to verify any aspect of `R`. `R` is available free of cost
as it is written and maintained by a community of thousands of
developers. Because it is community
driven, instead of every feature coming with `R` by default. Most of
`R` features come through add on packages. You can think of these like
apps on a phone. `R` is the operating system (Android, iOS), but often
you may spend most your time using apps (in `R` lingo,
packages). Like apps, there are thousands of `R` packages, and this
extensive ecosystem makes `R` one of the most powerful and flexible
environment for statistics.

This unit does not assume any background in `R`. Over the semester,
you will learn some basics of `R` programming, but mostly, you will be
able to copy and paste existing code and just change the dataset and
variables to suit your specific analytic needs.

This GitHub repository has a number of resources for the unit.
All code and much of the lecture content (both as HTML, R Markdown and
Word Documents and PDFs are available as well). If you want, you can
sign up for notifications any time any of the files in this repository
are changed.
